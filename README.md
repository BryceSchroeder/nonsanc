Engine/Framework for a browser-based 2D RPG.

*NOTICE* Development has moved to our private version control system, so that we can develop non-free assets used for the actual game. The engine of course remains open source under the AGPL. When the game is finished, we will upload the engine source here (or make the private repository public, whichever seems expedient at the time.) 

Utilities:
nse\_embed: Utility for making one portable HTML file from a template and
sundry resources.
