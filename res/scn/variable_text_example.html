This is an example of variable text output.

This illustrates random alternatives: [blue|green|yellow] is a color.
Some alternatives may be empty or duplicated, e.g. "Maybe [or maybe not||]."
All alternatives are equally likely, so duplicating them can coarsely 
adjust probabilities.

Random alternatives can be nested: [[blue|red] is a color|[A|B] is a letter].

Variables from the substitutions passed into the text output engine
can be referenced: The player character is named [Jack], and [his] [Sister] is
named [Jill]. 

If the substitution value for the name in the tag is text, it is put into the
output text directly. 

If the substitution value is an int or bool, it pre-sets the random number 
generator and generates no text output. This can be used to index random
alternatives using a substitution value which is an integer:
"Your favorite color is [favorite_color][red|orange|yellow] so I got you 
this [favorite_color][apple|grapefruit|banana] to eat."
Indicies saturate: if the value is less than 0, the alternative for 0 is 
used, and if the value is greather than or equal to the index of the last
alternative, the last alternative is used. 

As another example, for optional text using a boolean:
[ann_betrayed][|Did you think I would for get your betrayal, [Trainer]?]
Note that the <i>false</i> alternative is first, and the true is second;
this is because false is interpreted as 0 and true as 1.

If it is a function, it is called with the name and the
substitution value dictionary as parameters, and then the rules above are 
applied depending on the return type.

Brackets can be included in the text with the HTML special character
codes, e.g. &#91; example &#93;.
