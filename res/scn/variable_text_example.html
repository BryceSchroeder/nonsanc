This is an example of variable text output.<br>
<br>
This illustrates random alternatives: [blue|green|yellow] is a color.<br>
<br>
Some alternatives may be empty or duplicated, e.g. "Maybe [or maybe not||]."<br>
<br>
All alternatives are equally likely, so duplicating them can coarsely 
adjust probabilities.<br><br>

Random alternatives can be nested: [[blue|red] is a color|[A|B|C] is a letter].
<br><br>

Variables from the substitutions passed into the text output engine
can be referenced:<br> 
The player character is named [Trainer], and [his] [sibling] is named [Rival].
<br> <br>

If the substitution value for the name in the tag is text, it is put into the
output text directly. <br><br>

Tags can also be evaluated as inline Javascript: 2 + 3 = [$String(2 + 3)]
<br><br>

If the substitution value is an int or bool, it pre-sets the random number 
generator and generates no text output. This can be used to index random
alternatives using a substitution value which is an integer:<br>
"Your favorite color is [favorite_color][red|orange|yellow] so I got you 
this [favorite_color][apple|grapefruit|banana] to eat."<br>
Indicies saturate: if the value is less than 0, the alternative for 0 is 
used, and if the value is greather than or equal to the index of the last
alternative, the last alternative is used. <br><br>

As another example, for optional text using a boolean:<br>
[ann_betrayed][|Did you think I would forget your betrayal, [Trainer]?]<br>
Note that the <i>false</i> alternative is first, and the true is second;
this is because false is interpreted as 0 and true as 1.<br><br>

If it is a function, it is called with the name and the
substitution value dictionary as parameters, and then the rules above are 
applied depending on the return type.<br><br>

Inline Javascript can be used in the same way: 
  2+1 is: [$ 2+1 ][zero|one|two|three|four|five]
<br><br>

Variables can be manually established in locals with inline JS:
My reindeer's name is [$ locals.reindeer = "Prancer"].
[reindeer] is the best reindeer.
<br><br>
If you wish, you can suppress the output value of an eval tag by adding 
an empty string to the end, [$ locals["reindeer"] = "Dancer";''] as here.

[reindeer] is another reindeer.
<br><br>

If you are really creative or perverse, you can use eval tags like any
other tag... [ [$locals.reindeer = "<b>Rudolph</b>" ]| 
               [$ locals.reindeer = "<i>Jimbo</i>"  ]].
<br><br>


Brackets and pipes can be included in the text with an escape character,
a backlash, \\: \[this is not a tag\].<br>
My favorite special character is [\[|\]|\||\\].<br><br>

This is a local variable: [myLocal]<br><br>
